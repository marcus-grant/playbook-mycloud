# Ansible DevOps Notes

## Miscellaneous

### Install From Requirements File

```bash
ansible-galaxy role install -f -r requirements.yml
```

- `role` specifies install of roles vs `collection`
- `install` to install a given role by string or...
- `-r` to install from a requirements file
- `-f` to force reinstall or install newer version

#### requirements.yml

```yaml
---
- name: name-or-org.role-name
  src: https://gitrepository.org/name/role-name
  version: branch-or-tag
- name: ansible-galaxy-username.role-name
```

- Here you can see two kinds of role definitions:
  - Single key `name` where you can simply stick to the role name preceeded by the publisher of the role on [ansible-galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/)
- If the role isn't published on ansible galaxy you can pull them from a git repository instead using:
  - `name` key to give it a name you reference in a play
  - `src` key to point to the address of the repository
    - Could be github, gitlab, or a self hosted server
  - `version` key specifies which branch or tag to pull from

### Good practice pre task for any play

```yaml
# ...
  pre_tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt:
        update_cache: true
        cache_valid_time: 600
      when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
# ...
```
